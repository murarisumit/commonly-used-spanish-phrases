## How to Use Gustar Correctly in Spanish

* English “to like” requires a direct object while Spanish gustar needs an indirect one. 
* Shortcut: Remember when using gustar, the indirect object comes first.
  * Me gusta el chocolate: Chocolate is pleasing to me, or I like chocolate
  * Nos gustan las películas románticas: Romantic movies are pleasing to us
  * Me gustan las tormentas : (Thunderstorms are pleasing to me, or I like thunderstorms as tormentas is a plural noun, so the verb(gustar) is also plural.)
* You do not even have to take into account what you are liking or the conjugation of gustar! Just add the appropriate indirect object and forget about it.

  ```
  I → (A mí) Me

  You → (A ti) Te

  He/She/It → (A él/ella) Le

  We → (A nosotros) Nos

  You → (A vosotros) Os

  They → (A ellos/ellas) Les
  ```

 * Gustar will almost have two possible forms (gusta, gustan), depending on whether the subject is singular or plural, respectively except for 

### Me Gusta vs. Me Gusto

We conjugate the verb gustar as if it were a normal verb. But it's meaning changes a lot. 

Have a look:

```
Me gusto
Te gustas
Se gusta
Nos gustamos
Os gustái
Se gustan
```

But as you can see, it takes the form of a reflexive verb. What does this imply?

Simply put, if you say me gusto you are saying you like yourself. That might make people think that you are a little bit conceited, no?

Spanish speakers are very aware of this and **they generally do not use gustar as a reflexive verb unless they really need to** , like in the following examples:

* `Si nos gustamos tanto, ¿por qué no estamos juntos? (If we like each other so much, why are we not together?)`

* `Juan es muy creído. Se gusta demasiado. (Juan is very conceited. He likes himself too much.)`

* `Me gusto más cuando estoy contigo. (I like myself better when I am with you.)`
